Possible options for analysis:

Clearly, a logistic regression will be the correct model for this case. Sure, we could try
some decision tree framework, but I don't think that's really what the client wants.

We'll have (at least) four models - one for each response. But how will we choose the
"correct" models? 

I think we should build up a simple starting model, adjusting for the "no-brainer" variables
like:

(1) demographics
    - age, income, weight, gender

(2) health variables
    - high blood pressure, high cholesterol
    
etc.

Can use AUC to evaluate our model.

I think a nice way to estimate how important the variables are would be to calculate the
misclassification rate when a certain variable is exclude from the model
like:

var | coef  | p-val | misclassification rate when removed   |
x   |       |       |                                       |    
y   |       |       |                                       |
z   |       |       |                                       |

where we calculate misclassification rate using the average misclassification rate
from a model excluding variable j fit on 1000 bootstrapped samples.


For presentation, we can create a few things:

Summary statistics:
for a few basic variables do some summary tests, like t-tests comparing 
doc2004_bin = 0 to doc2004_bin = 1

for continuous:

for about 10 variables have a table that has
variable name | mean (sd) group 0 | mean (sd) group 1 | t-stat | p-value |

for binary:
variable name | proportion of events for group 0 | proportion of events for group 1 | chisquared | p-value |


Four column, ten row table: each column is a response variable, the variables
represent the top 10 highest chi-squared statistic values. Then we order them so that
it makes sense. (already completed in excel)

Also list the ten variables that were in the top 30 for each variable
