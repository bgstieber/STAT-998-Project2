(1) Four response variables are listed, but it seems like we actually might be most interested in the
doc variables. What is the importance of the HA variables?
	- better to just use HAC and doc?
(2) Obviously, if our dependent variable is from 2004, we can't use the variables from 2011,
but is it still okay to use the 2004 variables?
	- we can't really determine _when_ a HA happened...

(3) A suprising amount of missing data for birthyr for graduates. Can we just impute 1939 for missing
birth years for graduates?

(4) Some of the indices seem to be on different scales. Is there a technique that's normally used so 
that we could tranform the indices so they're all on the same, meaningful scale?
