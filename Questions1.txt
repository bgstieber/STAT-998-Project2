(1) What covariates or categories of covariates are you most interested in?

--response variable clarification

(1) Four response variables are listed, but it seems like we actually might be most interested in the
doc variables. What is the importance of the HA variables?
	- better to just use HAC and doc?
(2) Obviously, if our dependent variable is from 2004, we can't use the variables from 2011,
but is it still okay to use the 2004 variables?
	- we can't really determine _when_ a HA happened...

--summary indicies

(4) Some of the indices seem to be on different scales. Is there a technique that's normally used so that we could tranform the indices so they're all on the same, meaningful scale?
    - Why are there so many missing values?!

(5) Follow up to indices question: some spread between indicies - are there meaningful
breaks in the indices? Ways to transform from many values to a few, well 
defined categories?
    - maybe this is where a decision tree could be handy?
    

--recoding questions

(3) A suprising amount of missing data for birthyr for graduates (593 ~ 5.75%). Can we just impute 1939 for missing birth years for graduates?

(6) 170 individuals have doc2004 = "Yes", but doc2011 = "No" shouldn't these be recoded?
    - 63 individuals have hac2004 = 'yes' , but hac2011 = 'no'?
    
(7) There are a lot of variables that I would consider to be "no-brainer" variables like
variables dealing with blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, family history, BMI, etc.
We should be able to build a pretty substantial model using these values. If we build
such a substantial model using the "no-brainer" variables, will you be satisified? Or are
you looking to be surprised by our results?

(8) Of course, in statistics, we have an idea of what a "good model" may be. How would you
define a "good model" within the scope of this project? Is it one that predicts well or
one that includes many variables or something else?

(9) Do you think the graduate and sibling groups are comparable? Do you think it would be 
wise to fit separate models for each group?

(10) What worse:
    - misclassifying someone as a heart attack risk 
        - you are healthy but we say you aren't
        -- or --
    - misclassifying someone as __not__ a heart attack risk
        - you aren't healthy but we say you are
