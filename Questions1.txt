(1) Four response variables are listed, but it seems like we actually might be most interested in the
doc variables. What is the importance of the HA variables?
	- better to just use HAC and doc?
(2) Obviously, if our dependent variable is from 2004, we can't use the variables from 2011,
but is it still okay to use the 2004 variables?
	- we can't really determine _when_ a HA happened...

(3) A surprising amount of missing data for age - can we impute the age for graduates since
we know that _most_ people graduate high school at 18?
